Summarizing calculations were applied to the data set in order to simplify the result. Two aditional variables were added:

1. subject: ID of the subject. (int)
2. Actitity: Activity that was bein held while the measurements where taken. (Text or Factor)

A summary was done to all the variables by activity and subject.
